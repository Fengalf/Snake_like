# A Snake like game

## Functionalities

This snakelike game is utilizing classes, slices and loops. I was pretty much playing around with the Turtle library
and checked for what was possible to do.
Playing the game:

* Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake
* Colliding with the wall results in game over
* Colliding with the tail results in game over

## Known bugs

* If, before a screen refresh happens, 2 arrow keystrokes happen, the game over screen is triggered
** This behavior should not happen and MAY BE resolved in a future 'release'

## Future ideas

* Speeding up the game the more food is collected
* Adding difficulty modes
* Add a menu to select said difficulty
* Add a 'play again' functionality
